# OctoPrint-Octolexa

The Octolexa plugin for OctoPrint sends limited printer information to a database for access via Amazon Echo devices. The problem with other Alexa solutions is that they require exposing access to your Octoprint server over the public internet as well as require providing the external service with your Octoprint API key.

The Octolexa plugin eliminates that security risk by publishing only small informational status updates about your printer that can then be retrieved by the Octolexa Amazon Alexa Skill.

## OctoPrint Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

3. Click the ***Request Printer Registration*** button
4. You will be redirected to the Octolexa Login Page. If you do not yet have an account, click "Sign-Up" and enter a valid email address and create a password. You will have to verify your email address and then you will be directed to a page that will provide a unique key for your printer.
5. Enter that unique key in the box for Step 3 on the Octolexa Settings Page
6. Click the ***Verify Registration***
7. After the info is verified, click Save

## Alexa Setup 

1. Use the Alexa companion mobile app or website to enable the Octolexa Skill.
